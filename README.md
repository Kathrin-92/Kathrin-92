## Hi there!

ðŸ’¼ I work as a Data Analytics Engineer focusing on SQL, dbt, and Google Cloud (BigQuery).
ðŸŽ“ Before transitioning into data, I worked in communication, giving me both strong technical and communication expertise. I hold a BA in "Medienwissenschaft", a MA in "New Media and Society" and am currently pursuing a BSc in "Data Science".
ðŸš€ I've been working in data for around 2.5 years, gaining experience in database modeling, SQL, Python, data analysis, machine learning, and business intelligence.
ðŸŽ¯ Currently, Iâ€™m working on real-time data analytics projects and preparing to write my bachelor thesis.
ðŸ’¬ Always happy to connect! With my background in both communication and data, Iâ€™m looking to exchange ideas and network in the data and IT space.
